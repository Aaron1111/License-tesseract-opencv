## OpenVino Toolkit
---

Few layers of Yolov5 are not supported by OpenVino Toolkit and hence .xml and .bin will be added to this section once they are supported. Until then I am trying to find a workaround.

Once IR files are added, it opens up a lot of oppurtunities for this model to be used in different devices and deployed on traffic cameras. One can use these IR models in CVAT for automatic annotations of license plate and further improve the model performance with more diverse data.
